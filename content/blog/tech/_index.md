`Blog` is the place to record my life and work. There are 2 categories in `Blog` section:

- Tech: My thoughts and attitude to my works.

- Life: My reviews, especially to musicals, movies, etc. My travel notes and some moments that I feel something and eager to write it down. Fragments in my life. Short memos.

Besides `Blog`, I have

- Gallery: Pictures I'd like to share. My favourite ones.
